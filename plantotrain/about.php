			This is intended for runners with a bit of experience. It takes a recent race time and creates a marathon training plan based on Jack Daniels VDOT training.
		</p>
		<p>
			No plan is foolproof. That is why you should have some experience before using this tool. It will give you a pretty thorough plan but it is up to you to  know your limits and adjust the plan to stay healthy and uninjured.
		</p>
		<p>
			Basic Instructions: Put in a recent race time, your peak mileage, and the target race date for the training cycle. The output is a 24 week program with quality work that adds 4 miles a week up to the peak mileage. Look for tips in the output explaining different things. I added a few things to make it easier for athletes that use GPS watches to input the workouts.
